# Second-Hand Car Price Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains a second-hand car price prediction model developed using both linear regression and Lasso regression techniques. The models are trained on historical data to accurately predict the price of used cars based on various features. Additionally, the R-squared error score is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

The prediction models have been deployed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive user interface for predicting car prices. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for usage, and guidelines for contributions.

## Key Features
- **Linear Regression and Lasso Regression Models**: Implementation of models for second-hand car price prediction.
- **R-Squared Error Score**: Calculation and display of the R-squared error score to assess model performance.
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Deployment of prediction models using Streamlit, offering an interactive user interface.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and instructions for usage and further development.

## Usage

Train the model:
Run the Jupyter notebook train_model.ipynb to train the linear regression and Lasso regression models using the provided dataset.
Evaluate model performance:
Check the R-squared error score to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
Deployment:
Run the Streamlit app to deploy the trained models:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the Streamlit app:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit app.
    Use the interface to input the features of the car and get the predicted price.
