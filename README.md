Repository Description:

This repository hosts a second-hand car price prediction model developed using both linear regression and Lasso regression techniques. 
These models are trained on a dataset comprising historical car sale information to accurately predict the price of used cars based on various features.
Moreover, the implementation includes the calculation of the R-squared error score to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, the prediction models have been deployed using Streamlit, providing an intuitive user interface for predicting car prices. 
The repository includes comprehensive documentation and instructions for usage, enabling easy deployment and further development.
